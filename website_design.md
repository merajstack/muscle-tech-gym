<user_request>Create a premium gym website called "Muscle Tech" with black/red color scheme, multiple pages (Landing, Fitness, Amenities & Services, Trainers, Equipment), complex scroll-triggered animations including card replacements, scroll-jacking trainer reveals, and staggered layouts. Use placeholder image upload areas throughout.</user_request>

1. Create global navbar component with fixed positioning, scroll-based background change, and routing to all pages. Set up base page structure for Landing, Fitness, Amenities & Services, Trainers, and Equipment pages with black/red theme in globals.css
2. Build Landing page with full-screen hero, centered text overlay, and image upload placeholder. Create Fitness page with staggered triangle layout and scroll-triggered card replacement animation (Gym/Crossfit/Cardio → Kickboxing/Martial Arts/Yoga)
3. Create Amenities & Services page with scroll-triggered Z-axis replacement animation (Amenities cards slide back → Services cards slide forward)
4. Build Trainers page with scroll-jacking pinned animation that reveals trainer cards one-by-one from black screen before allowing further scroll
5. Create Equipment page with appropriate styling and image placeholders, ensure all pages are responsive and animations use smooth easing
